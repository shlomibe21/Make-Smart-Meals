# Make Smart Meals

## Description
Make Smart Meals is a great app for people who like to eat good food but also to make sure that they know what they are eating. Users can search for recipes for the entire day (i.e. breakfast, lunch, and dinner), define: the type of food that they want to eat for each meal, range of calories, number of ingredients, and some diet and health issues. The app will display up to 40 related recipes for each meal and some suggested YouTube videos.

## Motivation
I like to cook and to eat tasty food and healthy, so I decided to develop an application to help people to find recipes for great healthy meals with specific preferences like calories, number of ingredients and diet for the entire day.
