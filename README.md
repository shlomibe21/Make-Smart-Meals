# Make Smart Meals

## Description:
Make Smart Meals is a great app for people who like to eat good food but also to make sure that they know what they are eating. Users can search for recipes for the entire day (i.e. breakfast, lunch, and dinner), define the type of food that they want to eat for each meal, range of calories, number of ingredients, and some diet and health issues. The app will display up to 40 related recipes for each meal and some suggested YouTube videos.
